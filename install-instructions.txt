- rename .env.example to .env and change values
as you see fit (you can add facebook client id and secret,
if you added it you will need
to use https environment and you have to
edit app_url with the correct url for the app).

- make sure you have a database working and
  configured in .env file (default: fashion, 127.0.0.1, root)

- composer install

- php artisan key:generate

- php artisan config:cache

- php artisan route:cache

- php artisan view:cache

- run the migrations and seed to make
  a good working site for testing

- php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

- php artisan serve (or whatever webserver you would use to access the site).

- the default migration makes 2 default accounts admin and user

	user:admin@admin.com password:123123
	user:user@user.com password:123123
  also it will make 30 product with categories and images to test
